# Phasmophobia-Player-Logger
Player Logger for Phasmophobia to find other players more easier on steam (or report hackers directly to steam as the community support says)


How do i use it:
open the .py and change the path to your corresponding Path. If you encounter a player you like to add to your friendlist or to report run the script.
The output will be the player name and the steam ID. Run the ID through https://steamdb.info/ to find the exact profile. This also works for players with unsupported chars in the name.
